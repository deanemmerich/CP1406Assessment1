<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dean Emmerich<br>
  <strong>Login:</strong> jc428400</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of the website is to provide new or experienced CosPlayers with information of what CosPlay is, who the CosPlayers can contact and how to join the local CosPlay parties. The site will also provide visitors with the cost of costumes provided and what sizes they are produced in. The sites mian purpose is to inform users who are not familar with 'CosPlay' and give the website visitors a brief idea of what cosplay is and what Cosplay involves.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>A main method to measure the success, could be to intergate a feedback form on the site. Doing so could give the website developer an idea of which areas to improve on and which areas are perfect as they are. Giving the website developer constructive feedback will improve the overall user experinece, and possibly make the first time users return to the site multiple times. Another method to measure the success of the site could be to do a survey of the people at one of the CossiePlay parties, and acquire the opinion of Cosplayers at one of the parties. </p>
